= Asciidoctor Epub3 Footnote Bug Illustrated

This repo is intended to illustrate a bug in asciidoctor-epub3.
The bug causes the package to generate an invalid Epub3 publication when footnotes are placed in tables.
The numbering in the table seems to not consider numbering outside the table, so it gives its footnotes potentially duplicative IDs.
This causes the EPUB3 validation to fail.
Even in readers that will open the resulting EPUB3, footnote references are mangled since the later ones override the earlier ones they duplicate.
